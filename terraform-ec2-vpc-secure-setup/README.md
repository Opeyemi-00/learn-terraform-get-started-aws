# Terraform EC2 + VPC Secure Setup (Advanced)

This project builds on my previous work [terraform-ec2-with-module-variable-output](https://github.com/Opeyemi-00/terraform-ec2-with-module-variable-output). The goal here is to go a bit deeper ‚Äî using Terraform modules to set up a secure AWS environment with EC2 instances, a custom VPC, and security groups.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This Terraform configuration:

- Creates a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs  
- Enables DNS hostnames, NAT Gateway, and optional VPN support  
- Launches multiple EC2 instances into private subnets  
- Uses a custom security group that allows HTTPS and custom TCP ports  
- Uses variables for flexibility and reusability

üîß Prerequisites

- [`Terraform CLI`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- AWS IAM user with appropriate permissions
- AWS credentials configured via `aws configure`

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Opeyemi-00/terraform-ec2-vpc-secure-setup.git
cd terraform-ec2-vpc-secure-setup
```

2. Review/Edit Variables

Modify values in `variables.tf` as needed (e.g. region, AMI, subnets, instance count).

3. Initialize and Deploy

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
